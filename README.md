# Siamese-network
  Input two images and transform those into two feature mapping. Then calculate the distance of two maps, which indicates whether two images describe the same semantics.

  The network is quite effective in object recognition even withou much offline learning.

  Due to its strong ability of generalizing, we attempt to take use of it for tracking, which require little pre-knowledge and rapid calculating process.

  Furthermore, we are quite interested in adding channel attention mechanism to our network, which is demonstrated to be able to raise the accuracy of tracking and recognition.
